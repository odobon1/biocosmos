  cp_type:  2  # options: {1, 2}; class-pair computation type; 1: vanilla (i2t, t2i for same pair treated as separate "classes"), 2: negative pairs multiplied by 2, upper triangle extracted and used to normalize, full matrix constructed with normalized weights (i2t, t2i for same pair treated as same "classes")
focal:
  enabled:   true
  gamma:     2.0  # [0, inf); down-weights easy samples, larger gamma --> stronger focus on hard cases; 1-2 for softmax (InfoNCE), 2 for sigmoid; FL reduces to CE when gamma = 0
  alpha_pos: 0.5  # [0, 1]; only relevant for sigmoid; 0.5 equivalent to no pos/neg weighting; alpha_neg = 1 - alpha_pos -- DON'T THINK THIS SHOULD BE IN HERE (UNDER FOCAL)
  comp_type: 1  # options: {1, 2, 3}; focal loss computation type; 1: discrete targets only (positive/negative), 2/3: proposed continuous alternatives in support of hierarchical loss; nearly identical behavior for all 3 variants when targets=0/1; only relevant for sigmoid-based losses
